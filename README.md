Design pattern instructions
Use of chain-of-responsibility design pattern: Every employee is processing object, and every holiday request is commanding object. The supervisor(employee) can choose endorse or decline the request. For every supervisor(employee), if he/she chooses endorse, the system will check whether he/she have a supervisor, if yes, the request will be sent to next supervisor;if no, the request will feed back to the requester. On the contraryï¼Œ if he/she chooses decline, the system will send the feed back directly to the requester.
